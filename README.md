Basic web development projects

This repository contains a collection of basic web development projects that I created while studying a web development course. The projects demonstrate fundamental skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and include:

Dice Game: An interactive game where two dice are rolled to determine a winner based on the highest roll.

Drum Kit Web Page: A dynamic webpage that plays different sounds when various drum kit items are clicked, simulating a virtual drum set.

Simon Game: A web-based version of the classic memory game, where users repeat increasingly complex sequences of lights and sounds.

These projects showcase my foundational knowledge and practical application of web development techniques.
